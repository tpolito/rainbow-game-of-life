Bugs:
✔ Game does not run properly on "rainbow" branch. I think its either calulating the neighbors incorrectly or cells are not living/dying when they should be @created(20-02-13 10:27) @done(20-02-14 12:04)


Project Roadmap:
✔ Implement the "rainbow" feature @created(20-02-13 10:26) @done(20-02-18 09:17)
  Figure out the best way to add color to each cell. Right now the whole page goes white as each number hit infinity.
  Right now the function is taking the average of all living cells and assiging the value there.
